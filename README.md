# sh.compilemytex
Compile your LaTeX files with pdf LaTeX with ease.

## Quick guide
Place this file in the same directory as your LaTeX project. 

**Add permissions to the file** by typing: 
```bash
chmod 755 ./rerunpdf
```
You can now use the script for your LaTeX code: 

**Get help**
```bash
./rerunpdf -h
```

**Run your code** where the main `tex` file is called `rootfile.tex`. 
```bash
./rerunpdf rootfile
```
